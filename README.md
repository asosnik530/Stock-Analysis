 -The execution time on the refactored stock was much quicker than the original script.
  ### Summary
 The refactored script will run faster in the future. If you have additional stocks, you only have to update one array in the VBA. However, in the original stock majority of the script would have to be re-written if you wanted to evaluate additional stocks. 
 However, the refactored script requires another variable, and therefore the script is more complex to write.
